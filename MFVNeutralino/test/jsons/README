since /afs was unmounted @ lpc, symlinks replaced with copies:

2015.json -> /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions15/13TeV/Reprocessing/Cert_13TeV_16Dec2015ReReco_Collisions15_25ns_JSON_Silver_v2.txt
2016.json -> /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions16/13TeV/ReReco/Final/Cert_271036-284044_13TeV_23Sep2016ReReco_Collisions16_JSON.txt
2017.json -> /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions17/13TeV/ReReco/Cert_294927-306462_13TeV_EOY2017ReReco_Collisions17_JSON.txt

"2015p6" means add the corresponding 2015 and 2016 jsons.

"ana_".json are the hlt-menu-ok and prescale-ne-1 dropped versions.

"_10pc" or "_1pc" are 10% or 1% slices.

"ana_avail_*" are what condor/crab report say they were able to run on.
This is made after the first time condor/crab ntuple is run on the default set of datasets (currently JetHT) and the report is scrutinized.
Then you compare subsequent runs' reports to this file. (See utilities.py.)
